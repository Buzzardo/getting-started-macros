Now that your `Application` class is ready, you simply instruct the build system to create a single, executable jar containing everything. This makes it easy to ship, version, and deploy the service as an application throughout the development lifecycle, across different environments, and so forth.

With Gradle, you can run the application immediately using:

[subs="attributes", role="has-copy-button"]
....
./gradlew bootRun
....

An alternative is to build a single executable JAR file that contains all the necessary dependencies, classes, and resources:

[subs="attributes", role="has-copy-button"]
....
./gradlew build
....

Then you can simply run the JAR file:

[subs="attributes", role="has-copy-button"]
....
java -jar build/libs/{project_id}-0.1.0.jar
....

If you are using Maven, you execute `mvn clean package` and run the JAR by typing:

[subs="attributes", role="has-copy-button"]
....
java -jar target/{project_id}-0.1.0.jar
....

NOTE: The procedure above will create a runnable JAR. You can also opt to link:/guides/gs/convert-jar-to-war/[build a classic WAR file] instead.
